<p>Upon further reading and understanding the uses of Jekyll, I had doubts about myself in making this project for my friend. The more I progressed in making this project, the more I questioned how will he make the most of it. It converts plain text into static sites that can easily be used for blogs and informational websites. The result of this project is that his chances of getting hired are increased when people see his website, which gives him more credibility. The issue is whether this is the best tool I should be using to fulfill that. He honestly has no use in making blogs, and he does not even know what markdown is. In the back of my mind, I wonder how can I make it less complicated for him to maintain the website by himself.</p>

<p>After pressing on with my task, I noticed that one of my preview articles did not have a thumbnail yet, so my last task was to generate an AI image related to the topic.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-11-22">Wednesday (2023-11-22)</h2>
<hr />

<p>I would say that my desire for excellence is both my strength and weakness. It is my strength through my desire to deliver the best I can offer. It is also my weakness that, in my pursuit of that goal, I stress when things do not go as expected or when I take more time than necessary. I feel like I would have been done with the project by now if I had not fussed over the little things like the gap and margins between each element. I still wonder if this is the best option for my friend. I asked him for an example of what his website wanted to like look and after soon a few sites from his list. I realized “I should use something else” The idea I got from him was that I should make a single-page application type of website, and Jekyll was not the right tool in this case.</p>

<p>So I decided to give up on the project. Was it all for nothing then? I do not believe so, this has been an insightful experience for me which helps my critical thinking in situations like these. Making my own these in Jekyll has also helped me improve myself as an aspiring website developer hoping to freelance by next year so that I can work independently and on my schedule.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-11-24">Friday (2023-11-24)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Today was a very decisive day for me, I still hadn’t caught up to my peers regarding the Jekyll project. They started implementing their workflows, while I was still figuring out what font size I should have for my title. So took the path that my other fellow interns had taken, which was just to grab a Jekyll template and use their articles from the engineer’s log to populate the posts.</p>

<p>After minutes of finding up suitable template and after an hour of setting up the project. I was done, simple as that. I thought to myself where would I be now if I had just done this from the start but I think what I went through was necessary because the experience helped me learn and grow from my mistakes.</p>

<p>As usual, on my last workday of the week, I end my day by making my Friday reflection</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This whole week was dedicated to finishing my Jekyll project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Static vs Dynamic Sites</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/internship/2023/11/17/static-vs-dynamic-anthony.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Static vs Dynamic Sites" /><published>2023-11-17T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-11-17T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/internship/2023/11/17/static-vs-dynamic-anthony</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/internship/2023/11/17/static-vs-dynamic-anthony.html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we will find out what is meant by “dynamic” and “static” websites. What they are, what are their differences and benefits and lastly,</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="static-websites">Static Websites</h2>
<hr />

<p>A static site is a website composed of HTML files, wherein each file represents a physical page of a website. As the word “static” suggests, its code is fixed but can be updated manually. Static web pages are delivered to the user’s web browser exactly as stored. Thus, the same content is delivered every time the page is loaded.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of sites that can be made, statically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal blog posts</li>
  <li>Documentation pages</li>
  <li>Landing pages</li>
  <li>Portfolio pages</li>
  <li>Brochure sites</li>
</ul>

<p>The utilization of a static website might sound limiting, a lot can be done without introducing any dynamic elements onto a page.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, static websites will load much faster than their dynamic counterparts. That’s because your servers have to deal with far fewer requests, and there’s no database involved.</p>

<p>However, any website that requires a database is out of the question. That means that you can’t use static website generators to create online shops, blog posts with comment sections, websites with user registration, and so on.</p>

<p>Here is a list of popular Static Site Generators available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jekyll - a Ruby-based static site generator.</li>
  <li>Hugo - an open-source static website generator that bills itself as a “general-purpose” framework</li>
  <li>Gridsome - a static site generator with tools like Vue.js and GraphQL</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benefits-of-a-static-site">Benefits of a static site:</h3>
<hr />

<h4 id="static-websites-tend-to-be-more-secure">Static websites tend to be more secure.</h4>

<p>This is due to static websites not requiring to have any databases to store and retrieve information. This makes it so that there is no vital/sensitive data that may be stolen as what would only be hosted on the site is information that was willingly placed there.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-websites">Dynamic websites</h2>
<hr />

<p>A dynamic web page is a web page constructed at runtime as opposed to a static web page, delivered as it is stored. A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing. It has access to the server’s resources, such as its CPU, memory, and storage, as well as any databases or other servers that the web application uses.</p>

<p>A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via the Document Object Model, to query page state and modify it. Client-side processes, on the other hand, have access only to the resources of the user’s device, such as its CPU, memory, and storage.</p>

<p>By utilizing both scripting methods, modern websites can adapt to each user’s view of the page while decreasing server load time.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-a-dynamic-site">Benefits of a dynamic site:</h3>
<hr />

<h4 id="a-more-personalized-browsing-experience">A more personalized browsing experience</h4>

<p>Having a dynamic website allows you to give visitors a personalized browsing experience. This can include product suggestions and features for recently viewed items. Your site can also offer content based on location and demographics to help visitors stay on your page.</p>

<h4 id="scalability--maintainance">Scalability &amp; Maintainance</h4>

<p>A <strong>content management system</strong> that has the database for all elements, (including the content on the page) is used for dynamic websites. They also use scripting languages that primarily interact with all the database’s information, making it possible to execute site-wide changes without needing to do changes one by one. Uploading content and editing design elements or backgrounds can all be done with relative ease.</p>

<h4 id="better-user-experience">Better user experience</h4>

<p>A dynamic website is designed to be very user-friendly, allowing users to easily make changes to the website depending on their requirements. These sites are interactive, which lets the visitors leave a comment or reply based on their experience while they’re on the website.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<hr />

<p>When it comes to making websites, there is no one definitive method or tool to utilize. It all boils down to what you want to have in a website,  and the skills of the developer to implement those features. One has to know which tool to use to satisfy the requirements of an issue. In this industry, there are many ways to tackle the same problem, and that’s the beauty of being a software engineer.</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><category term="Static Sites" /><category term="Dynamic Sites" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, we will find out what is meant by “dynamic” and “static” websites.

It is mainly used for making blogs due to its “blog-aware” nature and its ability to read markdowns.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday-2023-11-13">Monday (2023-11-13)</h2>
<p>To start the work week after running the engineer’s log, which was made using Jekyll. Our next task was to make a Jekyll project of our own. Jekyll offers a wide array of pre-built themes to choose from. But from my experience, I know that I would learn and understand more if I were to build a theme of my own.</p>

<p>When it comes to building websites, one must have a clear idea of what the result should look like. Because if one were just to build with no planning, there would be more confusion on what to do and more reworks and changes would occur. This is why, before making the code for the website, I made a wireframe first. A wireframe is also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint. It works as a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of the website.</p>

<p>I wanted this project to have a real application rather than some imaginary user with an imaginary use case. I have a friend who is a music producer, two actually, one has worked on many projects from Warner Production Studios, while the other, has not had an official client. I offered that I could make him a portfolio website that he could use to pad up his resume and also increase the chance of him getting a client and he took up my offer. This would not only help him with his portfolio but also my portfolio.</p>

<p>The other task I had to do was to compare the differences in speed between statically generated and dynamically generated sites, other than that, I ended my day.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-11-15">Wednesday (2023-11-15)</h2>
<hr />

<p>This day’s task was to continue what I was already doing on my previous workday, which was making the wireframe of the website. Now that I made my wireframe my next step was to make the HTML and CSS. The issue I had was that even though I knew what to start, I didn’t know how to start. Because in the engineer’s log project, the only folder that I have altered was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post</code> folder, I knew what would happen if I placed a new markdown file there but I did not know how the rest of the project functions. So before moving on and starting the project, I extensively read the official documentation of Jekyll, which details what each part of the project is such as its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">liquids</code> and its “front matter” After reading, I immediately understood and knew how the rest of the project functions and what I could do with it.</p>

<p>The other task that I had for the day was to make an article based on what I read on the differences between static and dynamic sites and I was to have it done by the next workweek.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-11-17">Friday (2023-11-17)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Today was the day when I planned to be finished with my Jekyll Project. However, there were more complications than I thought there were. It took my time deciding what I what from the website. Although I prepared a wireframe, I felt that there was still more to be desired. I continued to watch more tutorials and read the rest of the documentation.</p>

<p>I dedicated the rest of the day to finishing my article on the pros and cons of statically and dynamically generated websites.

This week was spent familiarizing myself with Ruby and studying the nature of a decentralized git workflow</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday-2023-11-06">Monday (2023-11-06)</h2>
<hr />

<p>The day started with being tasked with attempting to run our engineer’s log locally on our Macbooks. I assumed it would only be a task that could be done in a few seconds, just follow the instructions and type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll serve</code> and I thought we would be all good. But it proved to be quite a challenge, things weren’t as simple as we wanted them to be. There were issues with write permission and things along those lines, so we attempted to override it by including the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> keyword. But that did not solve the issue.</p>

<p>After intensively reading the forums online the issue was due to the default ruby installation of Mac and what was recommended to do is to use some form of ruby version control. This task was easy to do because I had a similar experience with Python where I had to change my environment so that it would only have the modules that I needed.</p>

<p>Afterward, I successfully ran the engineer’s log on my device.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-11-08">Wednesday (2023-11-08)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Going back to my previous task, it involved using Gem and Gemfiles, which is like a package manager for Ruby with prebuilt code made by other people which is equivalent to the Node.js of Javascript and the Composer of PHP.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I decided to spend the day exploring and researching Ruby.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the day, I explored the concept of Git having a decentralized workflow. As it turns out, from the words of another developer, Git is both (and neither).</p>

<p><em>Git is centralized</em> in the sense that anyone with a clone of a particular repository is theoretically “equal” to any other developer with a clone of the same repo. One of the main reasons this approach is used is to allow any developer to continue their work without the need to always be connected to a centralized master server. If you have your complete copy, and it’s “equal” to any other, you can develop against it and sync up later.</p>

<p><em>Git is decentralized</em> in which, surprisingly, mainly for the same reason given above. One of the core concepts is that there is no need for a “main” server. The problem with that is, that in many situations (like a software engineer for a large company), there is a need to have a centralized master.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-11-10">Friday (2023-11-10)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Lastly, for this week, I have continued reading about git decentralization.</p>

<p>With that being my only task, I reflected on when I first joined this company and there our manager demonstrated to us how our pushed articles from the PR were added to the engineer’s log and the interns and I noticed how it went live instantly, all he did was approved our PRs and we could see our articles online already. With the knowledge I have, I now understand how that was possible, it was with the combination of GitHub actions, the CICD workflow, and Jekyll. So then I tasked myself with figuring out how to implement that process so that I may use that myself in the future</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may notice the gap between this reflection and the previous and and it was due to the “weeklong” weekend I had due to all saint’s day and all soul’s day.

As well as my thoughts on filling up my first check-in log which details my experience so far in the past 2 months. Lastly, I had to add images for all my past reflections and the one you are currently reading with an image generated by AI.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday-2023-10-23">Monday (2023-10-23)</h2>
<hr />

<p>I continued exploring CodiumAI, and there I found that although it is helpful, it does not fully replace human effort. After examining the code and generating test cases, there still have to be some adjustments for the code to work. So it seems that it still needs to take a long way to generate errorless &amp; functioning code every time.</p>

<p>I spent the other of my working day exploring PHPStan and PHPUnit, these are both tools for finding errors in one’s code and unit testing the project. Unit testing is a crucial part of software development that helps to ensure the quality and correctness of one’s code.</p>

<p>It can also be used to better employ Continuous Integration when it comes to large-scale projects, ensuring that nothing gets broken before a branch merges and automates this process so that there will be less need for human intervention so that the developers won’t have to spend their time waiting for the input of another developer who may take their time.</p>

<p>At the end of my work day, I had a one-on-one meeting with my manager in which he detailed to me the contents of a sheet that I had to fill up. It was a sheet regarding my experience so far with the company, what I have done, what has happened, the good, &amp; the bad.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-10-25">Wednesday (2023-10-25)</h2>
<hr />

<p>So I began filling up my check-in log and it was nice to take a step back and reflect on what has transpired in my life so far ever since I began my OJT. I am also thankful for the daily stand-up and my daily notes because they help me keep track and as well as help me remember what I have done previously. I would just like to say that if ever there was a chance I could talk to my younger self when I was depressed, I would tell him that everything would be alright and that he would be proud of the progress he would have made in the future (and also tell him to invest in bitcoin and dip out before 2021 ends).</p>

<p>My other task of the day was to include an image for all my previous weekly reflections/logs and the image would have to be artificially generated by any tool available.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-10-27">Friday (2023-10-27)</h2>
<hr />

<p>It was rather a slow day with not many tasks. We were advised to install Sonarlint, which is a linting tool to detect &amp; fix coding issues locally. I find the tool to be useful because it detects errors before I even run my code which I do find pretty helpful. After all, I did face some issues when I made my project in Python. Other than that, I spent the rest of the day continuously honing my skills in HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>I ended the workday by making my Friday reflection and attempted to use Midjourney by my manager however their free trial was temporarily suspended so I relied on using the tool I used previously and then I found out that there are different models that I can use that will give me my generated image in a different style, so that I can have my images more stylized than realistic.</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week was spent continuing my exploration of testing code for continuous integration with CodiumAI, PHPStan, and PHPUnit.

Throughout the week there was some downtime between our tasks so I also spent my time improving my skills as a web designer with HTML and CSS.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday-2023-10-16">Monday (2023-10-16)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Before starting, I want to recall back to the 2nd week of my internship. I cloned a project from the repository which was an admin ticketing system. It uses Google for authentication. We interns then installed ngrok and attempted to have ngrok host our project so that our local versions of the project could be accessed from each other’s devices. It was successful, however, we could not make it past the authentication due to an invalid request, we were stuck on this issue for a while and we did not know how to solve it. So we just placed it in the backlog of our mind and maybe attempt to solve it again in the future.</p>

<p>Two months later, we revisited the same ticketing system but this time we knew what we had to do. We had implemented Google authentication by ourselves in a previous project and with that knowledge. We successfully hosted our project and it was up and running, our google authentication was working this time because we found out what the issue was. This gave me the satisfaction of solving an issue that I wasn’t able to solve previously and it made me feel that I have improved.</p>

<p>Afterward, The rest of my time was spent reading and practicing the HTML DOM.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-10-18">Wednesday (2023-10-18)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Automating tasks was something I imagine would be doing in the future to further streamline my workflow. What I didn’t expect that I would be doing it this soon. The Github actions/workflow is a tool that I can use for this process. A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. All it has to do is wait for a certain event that the workflow is configured to look for. This could be a push the a certain branch or a pull request, these are one of a few of the many events that it could look out for. I however do not have any use case for this tool in any of my current projects, because I am the sole developer of my projects so I have no use for such a feature. However, I do see and appreciate its usage when it comes to continuous integration and continuous deployment.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-10-20">Friday (2023-10-20)</h2>

<p>Today was the first time I would be utilizing Artificial Intelligence in my projects. We were tasked to explore Codium AI, a code integrity AI agent, which analyzes one’s code and generates tests to detect bugs before deployment. It was also my very first time working with AI as I have not used ChatGPT at all unlike my other peers, it was a very helpful tool in explaining code that I could not understand at first and its code suggestions are pretty useful.</p>

<p>I had a considerable amount of downtime where I didn’t have much to do, so instead of just stagnating while waiting for the next task, I spent the rest of my day further studying and implementing GitHub workflows as well as further improving my skills in HTML and CSS.</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="CICD" /><category term="Workflow" /><category term="AI Generated Images" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, it was a continuation of our task the previous week which was to further study and read on Github actions and workflows.

<p>My previous task, which I completed on my previous workday, was to make a bash script that will make a backup of my web application and format it to a .tgz format and then I made a cronjob that would run that that script weekly. My new task would be an extension of that. What I will be required to do is for the backup on the server to also be available on my local device.</p>

<p>I spent my time rattling my brain on how to make it work. I was figuring out how I could let the server send the backup to the local device. After some time had passed, with the guidance of my manager, I changed perspectives, rather than the server sending the data to my local device, why don’t I let my local device fetch the data from the server? I then implemented that functionality and it was a success.</p>

<p>I spent the other half of the day researching CICD (Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment). It is a very useful practice that combines other practices continuous integration and continuous delivery or, less often, continuous deployment. Although I currently have no projects that may benefit from the implementation of this practice, I know that in the future, when I become a more skilled developer, with numerous projects on my belt, I have CI/CD as a tool for me to use to better streamline my workflows.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-10-11">Wednesday (2023-10-11)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Nothing much happened today, it was a continuation of what I did yesterday, which was to research CICD. I also researched Github Workflows and Actions, which is an automated CICD platform that creates seamless, versatile CI/CD pipelines in Github. I also spent my downtime improving my knowledge and skills by checking out and practicing with other technologies such as SASS, Vue, and React.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-10-13">Friday (2023-10-13)</h2>

<p>Here I was tasked to read about reverse SSH and what a Poor Man’s VPN is. SSH is a direct secure connection to another computer so that you can control it while reverse SSH, also known as Reverse SSH tunneling or remote port forwarding, the remote system connects with your local system.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the day, we review what the HTML DOM is. The other fellow interns were unfamiliar with the topic and perhaps also forgot about it, while I can still recall the concept when I was first introduced to it when I was in 9th Grade. Since I was more familiar with the topic, I was tasked to give my fellow interns a rundown of what the HTML DOM is. This gave me a small experience of what it would be like if I were the tech lead in a company’s project. What I would be doing is to first introduce myself to the technology of whatever the project will be using and understand it to help guide the developers that I am leading.</p>

<p>Basically, in layman’s terms, the HTML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. It presents an HTML document as a tree structure. And the way we access and manipulate these documents is with JavaScript.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent reviewing the HTML DOM and the ways to access the elements within the document as well as introducing myself to XML which is a requisite to know when I introduce myself to AJAX in the future</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><category term="Cron" /><category term="HTMLDOM" /><category term="CICD" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our tasks using cron jobs gave us an introduction to automating our tasks so that the server could run commands on an assigned schedule.

They are a way of scheduling tasks to run on your server. Cron is a service running in the background that will execute commands (jobs) at a specified time, or a regular interval. This week was loaded with Cron job-related tasks and I am glad I got introduced to this method.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday-2023-10-02">Monday (2023-10-02)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Previously, my task was to make a cron job run at a certain time however the issue is that it won’t perform the command at all when the time passes. The next day, throughout the weekend, I got notifications at 6 a.m. saying that the file/directory did not exist even tho I scheduled the task to be run at 10 a.m. This gave me the speculation that the command worked and is just that the output takes a long process.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the office, I was set on solving the issue. Thanks to the help of Jade, another fellow intern. The issue was so obvious, it left me dumbfounded. It turned out that the server that my cron job was operating on was in a different time zone, which is 15 hours behind ours. I tried to solve the situation by changing the local timezone of the server to be set to the timezone of Hong Kong, which is the same timezone that the Philippines follows. But unfortunately I wasn’t able to make it work. So an alternate remedy I implemented was to just adjust the time manually, meaning that if I want my code to run at midnight here in the Philippines, I have to schedule the cron job to run the task at 9 a.m.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, I dived deeper into what my task was last Friday which was Regular Expressions. It is a powerful tool to use and I believe not many people truly appreciate how much regex has helped them as they don’t even realize, at the core of it, all of searching is utilizing regex to an extent. Regex has been streamlined to the point that anyone and everyone can use it by just typing the words they want to find, without all the expressions.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-10-04">Wednesday (2023-10-04)</h2>
<hr />

<p>I began the day by reconfiguring my cronjob so that the backup would have a prefix to identify whether the backup was a weekly or a monthly snapshot. My previous application of the code is that there would only be two cron commands that run the same script one of which would be weekly, while the other would be every end of the month.</p>

<p>This is what the cron job used to look like:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0 0 * * 6 bash ~/dumpAutomation.sh 
0 0 30 * * bash ~/dumpAutomation.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The issue with this is that there would be no clear indication of which files would be the result of the weekly command or the monthly command. Sure you can just check the date in the name of the file and see if it’s the end of the month. But what if if the end of the week would also be the end of the month, what would happen to the file? would the monthly backup overwrite the weekly backup? So my solution to this issue was instead of creating a separate script dedicated to the monthly schedule, how about I apply parameters/arguments? So after a quick search, I was able to implement bash arguments.</p>

<p>This is the cron job with the implementation of arguments</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0 0 * * 6 ~/dumpAutomation.sh weekly 
0 0 30 * * ~/dumpAutomation.sh monthly
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Within my bash script here is how the argument is utilized</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>timeTitle=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%s)
//code for the creation of $timeTitle.sql is omitted for confidentiality
tar -czvf $1_$timeTitle.tgz $timeTitle.sql
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this script, the argument is stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code> and that is how arguments are utilized. If more arguments are necessary, they are separated with a space and to access them, call them from the order in which they were arranged, starting from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$n</code>.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-10-06">Friday (2023-10-06)</h2>

<p>I started the day by starting from where I stopped on my previous workday. It would be an application of what I have already applied regarding my cronjob. I made a bash script that will make a backup of my web application and format it to a .tgz format. Afterward, I made a cronjob that would run that script weekly.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of my afternoon researching Laravel events and listeners lastly, I ended my week by making my Friday reflection.</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cron Jobs!

For my project, I decided to make a website that shows my love for a topic I have loved ever since I was a kid, Pokemon.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday-2023-09-25">Monday (2023-09-25)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Today began with the continuation of making my website and applying what I have learned so far in this internship. I solved the issue of accessing my remote database and as it turns out the reason I had such an issue was that I was accessing the database from my local device and what I should’ve done instead was to access it through the server. As of recently, I have been into Pokemon again with my friends. We would play some Pokemon fan game that is played through a message board in Discord, an instant messaging and VoIP social platform. We would issue a command in the chat space and then a bot/script would do the command. This is what I wanted my website to be based around on. So as of right now, a user can register and log in to the site and view a Pokemon region and a list of all Pokemon from the region will show.</p>

<p>There was an issue, however, due to the repeated API calls the application has made, which slowed down the loading tremendously. So what I did was instead of showing all Pokemon, I decided to just show the starting Pokemon of each region and their evolutions. Lastly, the final feature I would add for the day is selecting your Pokemon buddy, which the user can do by to their region and clicking on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select buddy</code> button under their respective Pokemon what happens afterward is that in the brand name portion of the website, at the upper left, their selected pokemon will appear.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-2023-09-27">Wednesday (2023-09-27)</h2>
<hr />

<p>Since my past work day, I have been wondering what else I could add to the website. As of the moment, the user can register and log in, there are only two Pokemon regions so far and they can only access the region if they come from the same region or if they are a Pokemon Master (which they have no control over and must be overridden by me so that they have access).</p>

<p>I also had my friends try the website from their side and one of them reported a bug that I was not able to reproduce but I already deducted what was the problem and I have a proposed solution in mind already.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, I added more regions for the users to explore, and with that comes along, more Pokemon to choose from. I have also added a “trainer card” which acts as a user profile and along with it comes an avatar of a random Pokemon trainer, that is set upon the registration of the user.</p>

<h2 id="friday-2023-09-29">Friday (2023-09-29)</h2>
<hr />

<p>This morning, me and Jade were instructed to study Cron jobs and then have a bash script that will dump a MySQL database, which will execute weekly and monthly at midnight. After a quick research, I am thankful that I have come across this because I know that this will be a helpful tool throughout my journey in this industry.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon, we were given a lecture/refreshing on Regular Expressions (Regex), the last time I came across this topic was almost 3 years ago, using Sql. Looking at it now for a bit, it looks like a concept that seems complex and intimidating. But after some time, we were able to grasp the concept. Just like Cron jobs, I see it as a tool that I will regularly be using in my career. I know that shortly, I won’t be as confused as I am right now with finding the right statements to get the result I desire.</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week we worked on our websites to hone our skills in livewire and other tools.

It has been a very fruitfly experience so far although I may be biased since this is the path that I took, but I don’t think I would be able to do this much if I applied to any other company. I have gotten a lot of insight into what it means to be working in this globalized industry. Here’s a summary of what my experiences are so far.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="effective-communication">Effective Communication</h2>
<hr />

<p>Effective communication is vital to ensuring everything goes smoothly. In reporting bugs, it is necessary to make sure that the other party understands what you are talking about and make sure that you are both on the same page. There may be issues in communications, these issues could be the result of there not being enough clarity on stating what to problem is, and perhaps there is no mention of how to reproduce the bug that is being issued. Maybe there is no clear guideline on how to fix the problem that is being talked about.</p>

<p>To solve this communication gap, one would have to put themselves in the perspective of the other person, would they be able to understand what you are saying, with zero context? No matter how redundant it may be, make sure that you can drive the point across, to promote a more harmonious work environment.</p>

<h2 id="friendship-branch">Friendship Branch</h2>
<hr />

<p>Usually, when working on a project, each person would be working on their task and feature, which means that they will be working on an isolated branch with no interference with another branch to prevent complications such as affecting each other’s code. But what if the feature is a task too big for a single person to handle? Then it would require more people to work on the said feature. This would mean that the users assigned to that task would have to be on the same branch. This scenario was the basis of the exercise that I and my fellow interns have done. Our task was to work on a single file in which we would make an article on a topic we all agreed upon. We then understand what happens if the file we have in our system is not up to date with the file that has been pushed to the branch. As well as how we were able to avoid messing up each other’s inputs</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="stop-bugging-me">Stop Bugging Me</h2>
<hr />

<p>My fellow interns and I were tasked to locate, identify, and report the bugs we found in a project, as well as make a proposal on how to solve the issue. There were numerous visual bugs that we noticed as we had noticed and the next step we had to take was to report them through a ticket in Jira. In the ticket, we were required to thoroughly describe the bug, enumerate the steps on how to reproduce the bug, as well as suggest a proposal on how to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>This also acts as an application of my previous reflection, about effective communication. Although it may be a process that one, who has just been introduced to, sees as time-consuming. I reflected on that aspect and came to realize that bug reporting is a necessary step in the process to ensure that we adhere to the conventions and standards of this industry.</p>

<h2 id="public-key-infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</h2>
<hr />

<p><strong>**Public Key Infrastructure**</strong> (PKI) or Public-Private Key pairs. It is a system that uses cryptographic public keys that are connected to a digital certificate, which authenticates the device or user sending the digital communication. It protects and authenticates communications between servers and users. The Secure Shell (SSH) utilizes this concept as a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. Public &amp; Private key pairs are used together to encrypt and decrypt information. If anyone other than the owner of the private key tries to decrypt the information using the public key, the information will be unreadable. This is for increased security as it prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.</p>

<p>We did a short exercise on how to SSH to a website via the Macbook. Afterward was the real challenge, what we had to do was SSH from our Macbook into our phones and then, from our phones, we would SSH to the same website mentioned before. It proved to be a real challenge because we didn’t know how to place our public keys in the system we SSH’ed into. After a grueling 4 hours, we succeeded in the task and we no longer needed to include our private keys and had no prompt to input the password since our device is recognized through the public key we added to the authorized keys of the system.</p>

<h2 id="into-the-livewirelight">Into the Live(wire)light</h2>
<hr />

<p><strong>**Livewire**</strong> is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple. It renders the initial component output with the page (like a Blade include). When an interaction occurs, Livewire makes an AJAX request to the server with the updated data. This would result in only the component to be re-rendered.</p>

<p>The others and I were tasked with researching Livewire, which is a framework that was promoted to be easier and less complicated than other similar frameworks such as Vue and React. I started a new project and followed the documentation on how to make a component, along with watching a few tutorials that explored the functionalities of Livewire and its utilizations. Though I aim to do more complex projects in the future to further improve my understanding of its features, aside from that, it would also help me on Laravel as a whole and not only on singular components. I would like to make a whole project from scratch, from making migrations, controllers, and views to handling routes and such.</p>]]></content><author><name>raya-ay</name></author><category term="internship" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking back, it is getting close to two months since I started my internship here.
