This week, it was a continuation of our task the previous week which was to further study and read on Github actions and workflows. We were also introduced to testing our code, which is part of the CICD process in which we use Codium AI, a code integrity AI agent, that analyzes one's code and generates tests to detect bugs before deployment. Throughout the week there was some downtime between our tasks so I also spent my time improving my skills as a web designer with HTML and CSS.

Before starting, I want to recall back to the 2nd week of my internship. I cloned a project from the repository which was an admin ticketing system. It uses Google for authentication. We interns then installed ngrok and attempted to have ngrok host our project so that our local versions of the project could be accessed from each other's devices. It was successful, however, we could not make it past the authentication due to an invalid request, we were stuck on this issue for a while and we did not know how to solve it. So we just placed it in the backlog of our mind and maybe attempt to solve it again in the future.

Two months later, we revisited the same ticketing system but this time we knew what we had to do. We had implemented Google authentication by ourselves in a previous project and with that knowledge. We successfully hosted our project and it was up and running, our google authentication was working this time because we found out what the issue was. This gave me the satisfaction of solving an issue that I wasn't able to solve previously and it made me feel that I have improved.

Afterward, The rest of my time was spent reading and practicing the HTML DOM.

Automating tasks was something I imagine would be doing in the future to further streamline my workflow. What I didn't expect that I would be doing it this soon. The Github actions/workflow is a tool that I can use for this process. A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. All it has to do is wait for a certain event that the workflow is configured to look for. This could be a push the a certain branch or a pull request, these are one of a few of the many events that it could look out for. I however do not have any use case for this tool in any of my current projects, because I am the sole developer of my projects so I have no use for such a feature. However, I do see and appreciate its usage when it comes to continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Today was the first time I would be utilizing Artificial Intelligence in my projects. We were tasked to explore Codium AI, a code integrity AI agent, which analyzes one's code and generates tests to detect bugs before deployment. It was also my very first time working with AI as I have not used ChatGPT at all unlike my other peers, it was a very helpful tool in explaining code that I could not understand at first and its code suggestions are pretty useful. 

I had a considerable amount of downtime where I didn't have much to do, so instead of just stagnating while waiting for the next task, I spent the rest of my day further studying and implementing GitHub workflows as well as further improving my skills in HTML and CSS.
