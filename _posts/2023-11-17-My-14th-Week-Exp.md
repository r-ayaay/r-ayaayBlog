This week blah blah blah

## Monday (2023-11-13)

To start off the work week after running the engineer's log, which was made using Jekyll. Our next task was to make a Jekyll project of our own. Jekyll offers a wide array of pre-built themes to choose from. But from my experience, I know that I would learn and understand more if I were to build a theme of my own.

When it comes to building websites, it is important that one has a clear idea on what the result should look like. Because if one were just to build with no planning, there would be more confusion on what to do and more reworks and changes would occur. This is why, before actually making the code for the website, I made a wireframe first. A wireframe is also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint. It works as a visual guide the represents the skeletal framework of the website. 

I wanted this project to have a real application rather than some imaginary user with an imaginary use case. I have a friend who is a music producer, two actually, one has worked on many projects from Warner Production Studios, while the other, has not really had a ???. I offered if I could make him a portfolio website for him that he could use to pad up his resume and also increases the chance of him getting a client and he took up on my offer. 

My other task I had to do was to compare the differences in speed between static generated and dynamically generated sites, other than that, I ended my day.

This day's task was to continue what I was already doing on my previous workday, which was making the wireframe of the website. Now that I made my wireframe my next step was to make the HTML and CSS. The issue I had was that even though I knew what to start, I didn't know how to start. Because in the engineer's log project, the only folder that I have altered was `_post` folder, I knew what would happen if I place a new markdown file there but I did not know how the rest of the project functions. So before moving on and starting the project, I have extensively read the official documentation of Jekyll, with it details what each part of the project is such as its `liquids` and it's "front matter" After reading, I immediately understood and knew how the rest of the project functions and what I could do with it.

The other task that I had for the day was to make an article of based of what I read on the differences between static and dynamic sites and I were to have it done by next workweek.
