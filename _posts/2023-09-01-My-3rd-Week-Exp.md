It has now been three weeks since my onboarding. My body clock is now adjusted to waking up early, and to sleeping early as well. Too early perhaps.

I was tasked to use Jira, an enterprise software used for issue tracking. It would be the first time I'd be using the software properly and not just by playing and looking around. I made my tickets and added them to the backlog and when I saw the board, it was a familiar sight because I have already used Trello, which is also a software that tracks tasks and workflow. 

I believe this would be an experience akin to driving a car, which is that it would be exciting at first because it's a new experience but then as I gradually get used to it, it would be just a normal task. Like how I got my driver's license, I was excited to drive around but now, it's just a regular task.

While working using Jira, I came to imagine that this was how people in the industry would do, create an issue/ticket, give a certain story point score, and assign it to someone. This gave me a feel that I was also part of the industry, albeit me and the interns were just working on an isolated project.

What I would be doing on this day would be a continuation of what I did the past work day. During the past few days, I have been figuring out in my head how I would solve any of the bugs not only that I have reported but also the bugs that I found but didn't get to report because there were just too many. That way, when I get back to work the next day, I can solve the issue immediately. 

I ended up having an issue where my solution to a problem just created a new problem, so I had to find a different way to tackle the issue I faced. I know that this will become a common occurrence as I continue my profession in this industry, I am bound to make mistakes, we all are, and that is what makes us human. But what makes the individual is what they do afterward. We learn and grow.

My fellow interns and I were still finding and discussing the bugs we reported to each other to see if these were actual bugs and whatnot. We had a nice environment to collaborate in since we were right beside each other and it was even better that each of us was able to contribute to each other's work. I hope that such cooperation will continue to cultivate between us interns and eventually our future co-workers by the time we fully integrate ourselves into the industry.
