This week we worked on our websites to hone our skills in livewire and other tools. For my project, I decided to make a website that shows my love for a topic I have loved ever since I was a kid, Pokemon.

Today began with the continuation of making my website and applying what I have learned so far in this internship. I solved the issue of accessing my remote database and as it turns out the reason I had such an issue was that I was accessing the database from my local device and what I should've done instead was to access it through the server. As of recently, I have been into Pokemon again with my friends. We would play some Pokemon fan game that is played through a message board in Discord, an instant messaging and VoIP social platform. We would issue a command in the chat space and then a bot/script would do the command. This is what I wanted my website to be based around on. So as of right now, a user can register and log in to the site and view a Pokemon region and a list of all Pokemon from the region will show. 

There was an issue, however, due to the repeated API calls the application has made, which slowed down the loading tremendously. So what I did was instead of showing all Pokemon, I decided to just show the starting Pokemon of each region and their evolutions. Lastly, the final feature I would add for the day is selecting your Pokemon buddy, which the user can do by to their region and clicking on the `select buddy` button under their respective Pokemon what happens afterward is that in the brand name portion of the website, at the upper left, their selected pokemon will appear.

Since my past work day, I have been wondering what else I could add to the website. As of the moment, the user can register and log in, there are only two Pokemon regions so far and they can only access the region if they come from the same region or if they are a Pokemon Master (which they have no control over and must be overridden by me so that they have access).

I also had my friends try the website from their side and one of them reported a bug that I was not able to reproduce but I already deducted what was the problem and I have a proposed solution in mind already.

By the end of the day, I added more regions for the users to explore, and with that comes along, more Pokemon to choose from. I have also added a "trainer card" which acts as a user profile and along with it comes an avatar of a random Pokemon trainer, that is set upon the registration of the user.

This morning, me and Jade were instructed to study Cron jobs and then have a bash script that will dump a MySQL database, which will execute weekly and monthly at midnight. After a quick research, I am thankful that I have come across this because I know that this will be a helpful tool throughout my journey in this industry.

Throughout the afternoon, we were given a lecture/refreshing on Regular Expressions (Regex), the last time I came across this topic was almost 3 years ago, using Sql. Looking at it now for a bit, it looks like a concept that seems complex and intimidating. But after some time, we were able to grasp the concept. Just like Cron jobs, I see it as a tool that I will regularly be using in my career. I know that shortly, I won't be as confused as I am right now with finding the right statements to get the result I desire.
